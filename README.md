TODO LIST
==

fix the projects when minimized 
** make accessible for mobile




short term goals
--
add the iframes for side projects
fix the fcc iframes


when hovering display animation of nav sliding out from the right side of the screen
-- animation of circle coming out from and spreading from the burger menu
 


******** work on the js*********


to consider 
--
=> bullet point text to appear beside the iframe 
give it .2 sec animation to appear (more natural??)




details 
==
make the apostrophe change the theme of the page

~~



notes
--
hovering over the menu has to show the whole nav bar and removing cursor hides nav (animate it)
i want the color to spread out from the icon but how?
clicking on it makes nav perm clicking on a specific nav, hides the whole menu
~~ animation of page scrolling up/down


i think all the errors are because im using an img 
need chagne it
